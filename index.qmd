This is a collection of  code that has been developed, reused, and refined across the AAGI network — shared to make our everyday work easier. 

## What is this?

This is a curated collection of biometric code that has been developed and reused across AAGI projects. The focus is on practical, working code — the kind that often lives in personal folders but proves useful again and again.

Code here is shared to support collaboration, consistency, and efficiency across teams. Not everything is polished or packaged, and that’s okay.

## What kind of code will you find?

You’ll find a mix of materials, including:

- Analysis scripts and utility functions

- Data processing and visualisation code

Some contributions are shared as-is, while others are more formal software packages with their own governance. Each entry clearly states its level of maturity and intended use.

## How can I contribute?

Contributing is intentionally lightweight. You can:

- Share a function you’ve reused in multiple projects

- Make improvements by working on bug fixes to existing code

- Contribute to documentation with examples or data

Code does not need to be perfect or fully documented to be useful. The database team can help with that. [Insert easy method here]. Often clear context and basic attribution is more than enough.

##  How should I use the code?

This resource is sustained by recognition and collaboration. All code is shared under clear licenses and version control, so you can:

- Reuse it directly in your own work

- Adapt it to suit your project needs

- Contribute improvements if you wish
